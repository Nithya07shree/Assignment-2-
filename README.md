## Assignment 2 – Python Programs

Name: **Nithyashree R**

This folder contains my solutions for **Assignment 2 (GenAI)** for CampusPe, where each Python script focuses on a solving a specific problem.

All programs are written for Python 3 and are meant to be run from the terminal.

### How to Run the Programs

- **Step 1**: Open a terminal / PowerShell.
- **Step 2**: Run any script with:
  python scriptName.py

  For example:
  python factorial.py

Some scripts will ask for input from the user in the terminal and then print the result.

### Files and What They Do

- **`ageCalculator.py`**: Asks for a birth year and computes the person’s age.
- **`atmSimulator.py`**: Simple ATM-style menu to check balance, deposit, or withdraw amounts with basic validation.
- **`billSplitter.py`**: Splits a total bill among a given number of people, optionally including tips or tax.
- **`calculatorFuntions.py`**: Collection of arithmetic functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide, etc.) used by other calculator scripts.
- **`factorial.py`**: Calculates the factorial of a given non‑negative integer using loops.
- **`gradeCalculator.py`**: Reads marks or scores and outputs a corresponding grade based on defined ranges.
- **`leapYear.py`**: Checks if a given year is a leap year.
- **`multiplicationTables.py`**: Prints multiplication tables for a given number and a range of numbers(1-10).
- **`numberGuessingGame.py`**: Simple guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly chosen number within a limited number of attempts.
- **`numberPatterns.py`**: Prints various numeric patterns using nested loops.
- **`numberSystemFunctions.py`**: Functions for checking certain logical functions like factorial, prime numbers, fibonacci, sum of digits, reversing a number, Armstrong, GCD, LCM and perfect number checks.
- **`palindrome.py`**: Checks whether a given number or string reads the same forwards and backwards.
- **`personalBioCard.py`**: Displays a formatted “bio card” with personal details like name, age, and basic info.
- **`prime.py`**: Determines whether a number is prime, often by checking divisibility up to a limit.
- **`simpleCalculator.py`**: Command‑line calculator that uses user input and performs arithmetic calculations. 
- **`stringManipulator.py`**: Performs operations on strings (such as reversing, changing case, counting characters, etc.).
- **`sumAndAverage.py`**: Reads several numbers, then prints their total sum, average, minimum and maximum number.
- **`temperatureConverter.py`**: Converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit and possibly Kelvin.
- **`textAnalysis.py`**: Basic text analytics such as counting words, characters, vowels/consonants, or frequency of certain words.
- **`ticketPricingSystem.py`**: Calculates ticket prices based on age, day of week and number of persons.
